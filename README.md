## Code Institute - Milestone Project 4

![Image containing example of responsiveness within several screens](/static/readme/responsive.png)

This project was created for the last (fourth) Milestone Project of the Full Stack Software Development Diploma at Code Institute. The main requirements were to produce "a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service. This will be achieved using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, MySQL or Postgres, Stripe and any additional libraries and external APIs.

It was also a requirement to add payment facilities and this was achieved through using Stripe.

The live site can be found [here](https://k9kit.herokuapp.com/). 

**For testing purposes, please use the following credit card details:**

`Card number:` 4242 4242 4242 4242
`Exp:` any date in the future (please use MM/YY format)
`CSV:` any 3 numbers, for example 424

## **Introduction**

This project was created for the last (fourth) Milestone Project of the Full Stack Software Development Diploma at Code Institute. The aim of the site is to provide a pleasant online shopping experience in order for customers to view and purchase dog apparel. There are different types of dog clothing and accessories for sale, as well as toys. The site also features a sort of 'blog' area where periodic newsletters are posted by the site owners and also a 'tips' section where useful information for dog owners is posted every now and then.

There is also the option for customers to ad their own review on their experience when purchasing from the site.

Due to the nature of the business (clothes and accessories for dogs!) the tone of the site and design is all very light-hearted and playful, as well as the communication style.

All the wireframes were created with [Microsoft Paint](https://jspaint.app/).

I created a wireframe for each page, and the wireframes can be found here:

## Colour scheme <a name="colour"></a>

I used a mix of the same colours throughout the whole site, with mild variations whilst keeping with the hue and theme. I also chose images that complemented these colours in order to pull the theme together.

Below is a list of the colours which were used as the main features of the site:

- white: "white"
- black: "black"
- pink: #dd26a073
- blue: #00ffffe6
- blue: #4c7db3
- blue: #6f98c5
- hot pink: #dd26a0

The colour wheel for my base colour scheme can be found below:
